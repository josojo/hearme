"""Answerer — § 7.4.

Single LLM call: ``(persona_projection, question, style_guide) -> Answer``.

Strict identity-inference separation per §1.4 / §7.4 / §12:

* This function NEVER receives the DelegationToken or `unique_identifier`.
  It accepts only the persona projection (no demographics), the question
  text, and an optional style guide. The test suite enforces this by
  injecting a double that asserts on its call args.

* `rationale` is local-only. It is returned to the caller for the audit
  ledger but the Envelope layer never reads it. The boundary-leakage test
  also confirms the envelope POST body never carries it.
