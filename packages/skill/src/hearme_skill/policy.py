"""Policy — § 7.2.

Pure function. Reads user policy from YAML at ``~/.hermes/hearme/policy.yaml``.

Per §1.7 ("Indistinguishable response fidelity"), this layer MUST NOT branch
on whether the question is a honeypot. It does not inspect question text for
test markers; it only consults the user's declared topic policy and ledger
stats.

Per §11, payment fields are absent in v0 — `min_payment` is parsed for
forward-compat but never read.
