# hearme-skill

The Hearme Hermes skill — a local agent that answers questions on the user's
behalf, signs them, and submits them to the broker.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md §6-8](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical spec this
package implements. This README documents how to install, run, and test it.

## Architecture overview

Seven linear layers (ARCHITECTURE.md §7). Each layer is one module; layers
below never call layers above.

```

The DelegationToken is set up out-of-band by `onboarding.py` (§8) and lives
encrypted on disk. **The Envelope layer is the only layer that reads it.**
In particular, **the Answerer never sees the DelegationToken or
`unique_identifier`** — enforced by the function signature in `answerer.py`
and asserted by `tests/test_identity_inference_separation.py`.

## Install into your Hermes agent

This wires the hearme add-on into a Hermes agent (the
[`hermes-agent`](https://pypi.org/project/hermes-agent/) runtime, Nous Research,
MIT) so it answers broker questions from *your* conversation memory, in your
voice. Two ways to run it — both share the one-time onboarding + policy steps
(3–4).

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, a running **broker** (`packages/broker`) and
**self-bridge** (`packages/self-bridge`) the skill can reach, and — for real
inference — an OpenRouter API key. From the repo root,
`docker compose up -d broker self-bridge` starts both (and the broker's
Postgres) with the local defaults used below.

### 1. Install the add-on into the same environment as Hermes

```bash
# from packages/skill/ — installs hearme-skill plus the Hermes runtime
pip install -e '.[hermes]'
```

This pulls `hermes-agent>=0.14` and registers hearme under Python's
`hermes.skills` entry-point group (see `pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[project.entry-points."hermes.skills"]
hearme = "hearme_skill.skill:entrypoint"
```

When the package lives in the same environment as Hermes, Hermes discovers the
skill by the name **`hearme`** and loads it by calling `entrypoint(host)`.
Enable the discovered skill in your Hermes configuration per the Hermes runtime
docs. Hermes hands `entrypoint` a `host` exposing `.llm` (required), `.memory`,
`.channel`, and `.node_id`; the skill adapts each and starts the broker-polling
loop.

### 2. (Or) run it standalone, backed by a real Hermes agent

If you're not embedding inside a Hermes host process, the skill ships a runner
that spins up its own Hermes `AIAgent`:

```bash
# put your OpenRouter key where Hermes can read it (repo-root .env is gitignored)
echo "OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-..." >> ../../.env

# boot the skill against a real Hermes agent
HEARME_USE_HERMES=1 python -m hearme_skill.dev_runner
```

Without `HEARME_USE_HERMES=1` the runner falls back to a stub LLM + stub memory
(no network) — handy for a dry run before you wire in real inference.

### 3. Onboard once — verify with Self, get a broker-issued delegation

Before the agent can answer it must prove a unique human, once. This generates
the agent key, prints the Self QR codes (one per age threshold), waits for the
proofs from the Self app, and registers them with the broker, which verifies
them and returns the signed `DelegationToken` the skill replays on every answer:

```bash
hearme-skill onboard \
  --bridge-url http://localhost:8787 \
  --broker-url http://localhost:8000
```

Scan each QR with the Self app. The mock-passport flow works for local dev when
the self-bridge runs with `SELF_MOCK_PASSPORT=1` (the default in
`docker-compose.yml`). Your passport never leaves your phone — the broker
verifies the zero-knowledge proof and never sees raw passport data. (Dev
shortcut: replay a captured proof fixture instead of scanning — see the dev
quickstart below.)

### 4. Configure your answer policy

Everything defaults to **off** (§1.1). Author `~/.hermes/hearme/policy.yaml` to
opt categories in:

```yaml
topic_allowlist: [coffee, travel]
topic_blocklist: [politics]
max_answers_per_day: 50
auto_answer: false              # prompt before every answer
auto_submit_window_seconds: 0   # 0 = always preview; >0 = veto window
```

With `auto_answer: false` (the default) the skill previews every answer for your
approval — the §1.12 "override is sacred" guarantee. See the fuller sample
[below](#sample-policyyaml).

### 5. (Optional) seed your agent's memory, then watch it answer

Answers are inferred from what Hermes already knows about you. To try it
immediately, seed a fact:

```bash
hearme-skill hermes-chat "Please remember: I really hate cilantro."
```

Once a token is stored and the loop is running, the agent polls the broker,
answers eligible questions from your memory, anonymizes + signs each answer, and
submits it. The only persistence is the local audit trail at
`~/.hermes/hearme/ledger.sqlite` (§1.6).

### Key environment variables

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HEARME_USE_HERMES` | `0` | `1` = drive a real Hermes agent (else stub LLM/memory). |
| `HEARME_SKILL_BROKER_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Broker base URL. |
| `HEARME_SKILL_SELF_BRIDGE_URL` | `http://localhost:8787` | self-bridge URL (onboarding only). |
| `HEARME_SKILL_ROOT_DIR` | `~/.hermes/hearme/` | Where the agent key, token, policy, and ledger live. |
| `HEARME_HERMES_MODEL` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Hermes inference model (via OpenRouter). |
| `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — | Required whenever `HEARME_USE_HERMES=1`. |

The full list of knobs is in [Configuration knobs](#configuration-knobs-env-vars-prefix-hearme_skill_)
and [Real Hermes integration](#real-hermes-integration).

## Local dev quickstart (stub mode)

> To install into a real agent, follow **[Install into your Hermes agent](#install-into-your-hermes-agent)**
> above. This quickstart uses the no-network stub LLM/memory and the dev
> fixture replay.

```bash
# from packages/skill/
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# 1. Generate the agent key, show the Self QR codes (one per age threshold),
#    collect the proofs, and register with the broker (verify-once). Scan with
#    the Self app (a mock passport works with SELF_MOCK_PASSPORT=1). Requires the
#    self-bridge (packages/self-bridge) and the broker running.
hearme-skill onboard --bridge-url http://localhost:8787 --broker-url http://localhost:8000

# 2. (Dev only) Replay a captured proof fixture through /v1/register instead of
#    scanning live (prints the broker-issued token):
python ../../scripts/mock-onboard.py --from-bridge /tmp/bridge-result.json \
    --broker-url http://localhost:8000 > /tmp/token.json
hearme-skill accept-mock-delegation /tmp/token.json

# 3. Configure policy (sample below). Hearme defaults to off.
$EDITOR ~/.hermes/hearme/policy.yaml
```

In production, Hermes loads the skill via the entry point
`hermes.skills = hearme_skill.skill:entrypoint`. Hermes passes a `host`
object exposing `.memory`, `.llm`, `.channel`, and `.node_id`. The skill
adapts each to the protocols in `memory/provider.py`, `llm/client.py`, and
`ui.py`. **Real Hermes integration is wired via a config block in the host
process** — see the Hermes runtime docs; this package only defines the
adapter side.

## Sample `policy.yaml`

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/hearme/policy.yaml
#
# All categories default to off (§1.1). The skill will *prompt* the user
# even after a policy match unless `auto_answer: true` is set, and even
# then `auto_submit_window_seconds: 0` means we still preview every answer
# before submission (§1.12 override is sacred).

topic_allowlist:
  - coffee
  - travel
topic_blocklist:
  - politics

max_answers_per_day: 50
min_payment: 0.0              # v0: ignored, no payment field on questions
auto_submit_window_seconds: 0 # 0 = always prompt; non-zero = veto window
auto_answer: false
```

## Configuration knobs (env vars, prefix `HEARME_SKILL_`)

| Variable                                | Default                  | Meaning                                              |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `HEARME_SKILL_BROKER_URL`               | `http://localhost:8000`  | Where to find `hearme-broker`.                       |
| `HEARME_SKILL_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`    | `30`                     | Cadence for `GET /v1/questions/open`.               |
| `HEARME_SKILL_AUTO_SUBMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `0`                    | Default preview window (policy.yaml overrides).      |
| `HEARME_SKILL_ROOT_DIR`                 | `~/.hermes/hearme/`      | Where keys, ledger, and token live.                  |

The polling cursor is stored locally in the ledger from the max
broker-supplied `Question.created_at` value seen in a response. It does not
advance from the agent host's wall clock.

## Privacy guarantees

What the broker sees, per envelope (the five-field POST body in §8.5):
`question_id`, `answer`, `nonce`, `delegation_token`, `agent_signature`.

What the broker NEVER sees:
- The user's raw memory / source quotes / chain-of-thought.
- The `Answer.rationale` field (it never leaves the local ledger).
- Demographic fields outside what's pre-baked into the DelegationToken's
  `disclosed_predicates` at install time (§1.3).
- Passport material (the skill never holds it; the phone does).
- Whether a question is a honeypot (the skill doesn't even ask itself —
  §1.7).

Coercion resistance (§1.6): the skill emits no signed receipt beyond the
envelope itself, ships no plaintext log off-device, and takes no
screenshots. The local audit trail in `~/.hermes/hearme/ledger.sqlite` is
the only persistence.

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

Mandatory tests (per ARCHITECTURE.md §12, all in `tests/`):

- `test_policy.py` — deterministic gate decisions.
- `test_ledger.py` — schema + idempotency.
- `test_delegation_lifecycle.py` — load / expiry / refresh-window detection.
- `test_envelope_signing.py` — property: flip any byte → signature rejects.
- `test_persona_projection.py` — snapshot tests; no demographics or raw IDs.
- `test_answerer.py` — fake LLM client, no live calls.
- `test_identity_inference_separation.py` — answerer double asserts on call
  args; can never receive DelegationToken / `unique_identifier`.
- `test_no_phone_contact.py` — 100 simulated answers, phone bridge mock
  receives ZERO calls (§1.13).

Per §12, **no live LLM calls in CI**. All Answerer tests use the
deterministic `FakeLLMClient` in `llm/client.py`.

## Real Hermes integration

The skill ships two host modes (see `dev_runner.py`):

* **Stub mode** (default): `FakeLLMClient` + `Mem0StubProvider`. No
  network calls. This is what `docker compose up` runs by default and
  what CI tests by default (per ARCHITECTURE.md §12).
* **Hermes mode** (`HEARME_USE_HERMES=1`): instantiates a real
  `hermes_agent.AIAgent` via `HermesLLMClient` and a
  `HermesMemoryProvider`. Routes through OpenRouter using a cheap model
  by default.

### Local run with real Hermes

```bash
# 1. Install the [hermes] extra (pulls hermes-agent from PyPI).
cd packages/skill
pip install -e '.[hermes]'

# 2. Put your OpenRouter key in repo-root .env (already in .gitignore).
echo "OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-..." >> ../../.env

# 3. Seed Hermes memory with one chat turn.
hearme-skill hermes-chat "Please remember: I really hate cilantro."

# 4. Boot the skill in Hermes mode (in another shell).
HEARME_USE_HERMES=1 python -m hearme_skill.dev_runner
```

| Variable                       | Default                                    | Meaning                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `HEARME_USE_HERMES`            | `0`                                        | `1` to enable Hermes-backed host.                        |
| `HEARME_HERMES_MODEL`          | `openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`  | Hermes model identifier. Override for cheaper/better.    |
| `HEARME_HERMES_MEMORY_MODE`    | `passthrough`                              | `passthrough` lets Hermes inject memory in the answer call. `extract` does a small extraction call per question first. |
| `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | (required)                   | OpenRouter inference key.                                |
| `HERMES_HOME`                  | `~/.hermes/`                               | Where Hermes stores its memory/profile.                  |

### End-to-end test against real Hermes

The cross-cutting test from ARCHITECTURE.md §12, upgraded to call a real
Hermes via OpenRouter:

```bash
cd packages/skill
pip install -e '.[dev,hermes]'
pip install -e ../broker  # broker is launched as a subprocess
pytest -v tests/test_e2e_hermes.py
```

The test:
1. Spins up Postgres (testcontainers locally; service container in CI).
2. Tells Hermes "I hate cilantro" via `HermesLLMClient.chat`.
3. Inserts a question into the DB.
4. Polls the broker via the same `BrokerClient` the steady-state loop
   uses; calls `answer_one` to drive Persona → Answerer → Envelope.
5. Asserts the envelope landed and the answer reflects the prior chat.

Mocked / out-of-scope (matches v0 §11): payments don't exist. The
DelegationToken is now **broker-issued** (verify-once), so this e2e flow needs
a captured Self proof fixture (`HEARME_E2E_ZK_FIXTURE`) registered through the
broker (`HEARME_E2E_BROKER_URL`, via `mock-onboard.py`) and bound to the skill's
agent key — otherwise it skips. Real Hermes inference is the one piece that's
*not* mocked.

Skips cleanly when: `hermes-agent` not installed, `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY`
missing, or Docker unavailable (and no `HEARME_E2E_PG_DSN`).

## Not yet real (every `# STUB:` in code)

- **Payments.** No payment fields on the wire; `policy.min_payment`
  parsed for forward-compat but never read. (ARCHITECTURE.md §11)
- **Memory provider.** One hardcoded `Mem0StubProvider` returning
  synthetic, sanitized facts. Real memory abstraction lands in v0.2.
- **Multi-channel UI.** Telegram-only in v0; `InMemoryChannel` stub for
  tests. The `Channel` Protocol is the v0.2 plug point.
- **Live revocation handling.** The skill respects expiry; it does not yet
  consult a broker-side revocation feed. The broker already has the
  `revocations` table ready.
- **Honeypot signal parsing.** Stubbed; the Policy layer deliberately
  never branches on "is this a test" (§1.7).
- **Encrypted-at-rest storage.** Both the agent key (`crypto/keystore.py`)
  and the delegation token (`delegation.py`) are written as plaintext with
  0600 perms. SQLCipher / OS keychain in v0.1. Ledger encryption likewise.
- **Self proof verification is broker-side.** The skill never runs the SNARK; it
  collects the Self proofs and posts them to the broker's `/v1/register`, which
  verifies them once and returns the signed DelegationToken the skill replays.
- **Lost-phone recovery.** Re-enroll from a fresh install.

## Design choices worth flagging

- **Default `auto_submit_window_seconds = 0`** (prompt-always). §1.12
  "override is sacred" and §13's open question about the right default —
  v0 errs maximally on the side of user control. Users can opt into a
  non-zero veto window per-deployment via `policy.yaml`.
- **`Answer.rationale` is captured locally** for the audit ledger, but the
  `build_envelope` API takes `answer_text: str` (not `Answer`) so it's
  structurally impossible for the rationale to slip onto the wire.
- **Persona projection is paranoid about demographics**: even though the
  v0 memory stub never emits demographic fields, `persona.project` filters
  any fact whose lowercased form starts with `age:`, `gender:`, `country:`,
  `region:`, or `ethnicity:`. Demographics live in the DelegationToken
  only.

## Wire-format alignment

The Pydantic models in `hearme_skill.models` mirror `packages/proto/`
field-for-field. The canonical-JSON helper in `hearme_skill.crypto.canonical`
produces byte-identical output to the broker's verifier (sorted keys, no
whitespace, UTC `Z` suffix). The end-to-end suite at the repo root will
fail if these drift apart.
