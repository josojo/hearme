"""GET /v1/questions/open — agents poll here.

ARCHITECTURE.md §5: returns rows where ``status='open' AND closes_at > now()``
and, if ``since`` is provided, ``created_at >= since``. Each row carries
``created_at`` as the server-side cursor source plus the per-question ``nonce``
the agent will bind into the envelope signature.
