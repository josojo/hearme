"""Per-client rate limiting (v0 — basic public-API hygiene).

The composite PK on ``envelopes`` already stops duplicate Sybil writes at the
DB layer (ARCHITECTURE.md §3), but the *verify pipeline* still runs per
request (delegation signature checks, registry reads, eligibility, agent
signature verify), and ``/v1/register`` does a real Self-bridge round-trip.
A single attacker can burn CPU / DB / bridge calls with bogus posts. This
module is the v0 bound on that: per-client sliding-window quotas on the
write endpoints.

The limiter is **in-memory and per-process**. That is the right v0 choice
(single-instance broker per ARCHITECTURE §2; no new infra) and the wrong
mainnet choice (lost on restart; does not aggregate across replicas). The
follow-up is Redis or a shared cache — but the policy surface defined here
stays the same.

What it limits:
  * ``POST /v1/register``           — registration is the most expensive path
    (Self-bridge call + on-chain Celo read), kept tight.
  * ``POST /v1/envelopes``          — the high-volume hot path; per-IP cap
    bounds a flood of bogus envelopes from one source.
  * ``POST /v1/envelopes/revoke``   — same shape as envelopes; bound the
    same way (it is also a signed write that runs verification).

What it does **not** limit:
  * Read endpoints (``GET /v1/questions/open``, ``GET /v1/stats``,
    ``/healthz``). Agents poll these on their own cadence and they have no
    per-request side effects; rate-limiting them would hurt honest agents
    while doing nothing about a DoS that can just open more connections.

Client identification (``X-Real-IP`` then ``X-Forwarded-For`` then peer)
matches the v0 deployment shape (Caddy in front, single host — see
``Caddyfile``). If the broker is ever exposed without a trusted proxy,
``X-Real-IP`` MUST NOT be honored — operators can disable header trust by
setting ``ratelimit_trust_proxy_headers=False``.
