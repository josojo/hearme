-- Enforcement boundary (ARCHITECTURE.md §2, §4):
--   hearme_web    — writes questions only; reads public aggregates.
--   hearme_broker — writes envelopes, aggregates, revocations; reads questions, askers.

-- Passwords here are dev-only. Production deploys must override these
-- via secrets injection before the init script runs.
